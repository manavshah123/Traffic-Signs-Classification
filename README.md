# Traffic-Signs-Classification

<h2> 1.	Introduction</h2>
This case study is designed to Classify the traffic signs. It uses the Sequential and ResNet model for the images. The model built is able to grid the image and train model accordingly and then predict the sign from them.
This case study can be used across various sectors where there is a need to have the Traffic sign classification. Also, if this model is trained with more resources like GPU, RAM then it can be expanded to cover variety of traffic signs categories.
